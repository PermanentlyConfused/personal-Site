            This project started off as "Can I build Minecraft from scratch?". I
            found out very quickly that the short answer was "No" as there were
            too many different elements that has to come together to create the
            Minecraft we know today. Instead of giving up, I started several
            small projects that will(hopefully) teach me enough to eventually
            allow me to build minecraft from scratch one day. The goal of this
            project was for me to learn how to use perlin noise to create a
            world and visualize it on a 2D plane. However, having a world
            without any occupants feels desolate and sad so I also added
            artificial birds through the use of Boid's algorithm to interact
            with the world.

            For this world's generation, I have a total of 6 layers of perlin
            noise octaves 3,6,12,25,50,80. By summing up all of these signals
            while halving their weights for each octave, I was able to have a 1D
            signal that looks "random" with decent fine details. In order to
            convert this to 2D plane, I created a 2D matrix(based on window
            width and height) and computed the weighted sum of noise values for
            each grid cell. Lastly, I created a range based on min/max values in
            the 2D matrix to normalize and create a integer-based mapping for
            the terrain.

            Boids Algorithm(Flocks of Birds Simulation)
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base">
            Boid's algorithm is simple and can be broken up into three main
            concepts: Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion. Each of the "bird" in
            the flock is an object that has its own position, velocity, and
            acceleration vectors that can interact with other object's
            variables. Separation induces a small acceleration vector opposite
            to the other boid objects if their positions are too close to each
            other. Alignment will adjust the acceleration vector of the
            individual boid based on the other boids' velocity that are in close
            proximity. Cohesion acts as a reverse separation force to keep the
            boids in a group together by directing the acceleration vector
            towards the center of the local boid group. I wanted the birds to
            avoid very high terrains so I ran a BFS algorithm on the map to get
            "clumps" of the snow terrains in close proximity and create an
            acceleration vector directing the boids AWAY from the center of
            these "clumps".
