            I'm a computer engineer
            <b className="text-lg">(glorified software engineerðŸ˜…) </b>
            with a strong passion for improving everyday user experiences
            through technology. Originally born in Russia but proudly raised
            with Vietnamese roots, my journey in engineering has been shaped by
            a unique blend of cultural influences and an unwavering drive to
            solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-lg">
            My approach to development is centered on prioritizing stability and
            simplicity while remaining open to continuous learning and
            improvement. I am always seeking new ways to enhance my skills and,
            in turn, elevate the user experience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-lg">
            When I'm not immersed in code, I love winding down on my guitar and
            playing video games. I also love relaxing by a campfire outdoors.
            Though I'm always up for trying out new experiences at any time.
